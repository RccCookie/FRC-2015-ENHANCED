FRC-2015-ENHANCED
======
This is the rewritten code for the 2015-robot, SANIC M8; This new code contains some of the following features:
- Rewritten operational code for the robot, almost everything is different due to the switch from Xbox-controller to Logitech-joystick
- Smooth-arcade-driving to allow for the smooth operation of the robot (maybe a sine function?)
- Implementation of new programming standards into the general programming done by the team
- Using encoders and control-loops to allow for advanced autonomous functions (eventually using a spline function)

## TO-DO LIST
- [x] Create repository, README, and .gitignore
- [ ] Start work on the rewriting and optimization of the base code
- [ ] Read values from the encoders and translate the data to velocity and distance
- [ ] Implement basic autonomous functions
- [ ] Work on the implementation of the advanced spline-fit functions for autonomous control

  More will be added as the need rises...
